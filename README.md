# Status Trio

This is a personal fork of [lingyired/status-trio](https://github.com/lingyired/status-trio) with optional **Codex remaining-quota dots** in the menu bar and Dock. Upstream retains its focus on system status; see [#10](https://github.com/lingyired/status-trio/issues/10). Choose **Settings → App Icon → Bottom dots**. The fork uses a separate, currently empty update feed so stock upstream releases cannot overwrite this feature. Builds are available as non-publishing Actions artifacts; no fork auto-update releases are published yet.

Status Trio is a native macOS status app that combines Wi-Fi, battery, and volume into one compact, configurable icon, shown in the menu bar, in the Dock, or in both. It is inspired by the iPhone Duo's combined status bar icon for Wi-Fi, Battery, and Cellular Data, adapted for Mac with Volume instead of Cellular Data.

> Status Trio is an independent project and is not affiliated with Apple.

## Highlights

- **One combined status icon** — keeps battery, Wi-Fi, and volume in a single icon.
- **Menu bar or Dock** — choose where the live icon lives: the menu bar, the Dock, or both, with a Dock icon that follows the macOS icon style.
- **Configurable rendering** — choose an icon size from 16–36 pt, with 28 pt as the default.
- **Connection icon choices** — optionally use the standard Wi-Fi signal icon for Ethernet, Personal Hotspot, temporary connections, or Internet Sharing.
- **Detailed battery status** — percentage, a charging bolt or a plug while connected without charging, estimated time to full, Low Power Mode, and a Battery Settings shortcut.
- **Wi-Fi awareness** — signal strength, current network name, and common connection states.
- **Volume at a glance** — output level and mute state, with controls available from the popover.
- **macOS-native controls** — left-click for a status popover and right-click for the standard menu, from either the menu bar icon or the Dock icon.
- **Efficient updates** — event-driven monitoring with a low-frequency polling fallback.
- **Twelve languages** — follow the system language or choose one manually; changes apply immediately.
- **Launch at login** — optional startup with guidance when macOS requires approval.

## Dock icon

The same live icon can live in the Dock instead of the menu bar, or in both places at once:

</p>

The Dock icon can follow the system icon style or be pinned to a fixed background:

</p>

## Icon states

Every state the combined icon can show, drawn by the app's own renderer — battery indicators on top, Wi-Fi in the middle, volume dots or the arc at the bottom:

  <img src="screenshots/status-trio-icon-states.png" width="880" alt="Status Trio icon states: charging, plugged in, percentage, low battery, and Low Power Mode at the top; Wi-Fi signal, hotspot, temporary, shared, and wired states in the middle; volume dots and arc styles at the bottom">
</p>

The same states rendered for a dark menu bar:

## Requirements

- macOS 15 or later
- Swift 6 toolchain (Xcode 16 or later)

## Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lingyired/status-trio.git
cd status-trio
swift run StatusTrio
```

## Build a local app

Build an ad-hoc-signed app bundle and launch it:

```bash
bash scripts/build-app.sh release
```

The bundle is created at `dist/StatusTrio.app`. To build without quitting or launching an existing instance, run:

```bash
bash scripts/build-app.sh release no-open
```

The ad-hoc-signed bundle is intended for local personal use. Gatekeeper may reject it if the bundle is transferred with quarantine metadata.

## Install a GitHub Release

Download the latest `StatusTrio-*.dmg` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/lingyired/status-trio/releases), open it, and copy `Status Trio.app` into `/Applications`.

The current public build is ad-hoc signed but is not notarized by Apple. macOS may show this warning on first launch:

> Apple cannot verify “Status Trio” is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

This is a Gatekeeper warning caused by the missing Developer ID signature and Apple notarization. It does not by itself mean the app contains malware. Only bypass the warning when the DMG was downloaded from the official GitHub Releases page and its published SHA-256 checksum matches.

After copying the app into `/Applications`, remove the quarantine attribute and open it:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Status Trio.app"
open "/Applications/Status Trio.app"
```

Alternatively, try to open the app once, then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway**.

Do not disable Gatekeeper globally. Subsequent Sparkle updates are authenticated with the app's EdDSA signing key; the `xattr` command is normally needed only for the first manual installation.

## Usage

- **Left-click** the menu bar icon or the Dock icon to open the status popover.
- **Right-click** either icon for the native menu, including version and quit actions.
- Open **Settings** to choose where the icon is shown (menu bar, Dock, or both), and to change the icon size, connection icon style, battery display options, language, update checks, and launch-at-login behavior.
- Enable the current Wi-Fi network name when prompted; macOS requests location access for this optional detail.

## Languages

Status Trio follows the macOS preferred language by default and includes English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic.

## Privacy

Status Trio reads status through public macOS frameworks. It does not use App Sandbox or require a network entitlement, and it does not include telemetry or analytics. Location access is optional and requested only when you choose to display the current Wi-Fi network name.

## Development

Run the test suite:

```bash
swift test
```

Run a focused XCTest filter through the helper:

```bash
bash scripts/test.sh BatteryMonitorTests
```

To build a worktree app alongside the main installation:

```bash
bash scripts/build-worktree.sh release
```

The helper derives a development bundle identifier and display name from the current branch. Both values can be overridden:

```bash
BUNDLE_ID=com.lingsmbp.StatusTrio.dev.settings-redesign \
APP_NAME="Status Trio (Settings Redesign)" \
bash scripts/build-worktree.sh release
```

The single-instance lock is scoped by bundle identifier, so differently identified builds can run at the same time.

## Technical baseline

- Swift 6
- SwiftUI + AppKit
- macOS 15+
- `LSUIElement` menu bar accessory that switches to a regular activation policy while the Dock icon is shown
- Sparkle for update checks

## Optional Codex quota dots

In Settings → App Icon → Bottom dots, choose Codex 5-hour or weekly remaining usage instead of volume. This opt-in feature uses a local Codex ChatGPT login; see [setup, privacy, and limitations](docs/codex-quota.md).
